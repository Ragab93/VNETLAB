<h2>About V-NetLab</h2>
<p>
At V-NetLab users will be able to create virtual networks and save them for later use. 
Users will be able to create an account or log in to an existing one. From there you can 
create a new virtual network or load up a saved network from before. Virtual networks 
created can be saved for use or for further modifications at a later time.
</p>


<h2>What to do</h2>
<p>
New users will need to click "Add a Network Configuration" on the Home page to get started. 
Once the page loads you can start creating a virtual network with the GUI interface. 
Simply use the "Add Hosts" or "Add Switch" buttons to add the appropriate item to the GUI. 
Edit the network displayed in the box as desired. Lines show the connections between network 
devices. When finised type a name to save the network as in the small box above the GUI 
interface then click on "Save Network". Existing users can load up saved networks by clicking 
on "View Saved Configurations". By loading existing networks users can modify and use the 
virtual network as needed.

<h3>Lead Programmer: Matt Diederick</h3>
<p>
Matt Diederick has been programming off and on as both a hobby and a job for about 9
years. Matt currently works as a C# and asp.net developer for a company in Cleveland that
specializes in software for the healthcare industry. He has worked on Java/android and angularJS
development in the past. He’s learned in his new job that it is crucial to strengthen software
engineering skills particularly in agile and test-driven development. Matt Diederick has the 
most experience programming and helped others on the team by proof reading any code submitted 
and providing guidance on how the program should run. Matt also maintained web hosting capability 
through Azure.

<h3>Program Architecture: Anthony Figueroa</h3>
<p>
Anthony Figueroa is a senior and a Computer Science and Engineering major. He’s
worked primarily with Java as far as programming courses go at the University of Toledo
with some minor courses covering the basics of C, Python, and is currently in courses in
Assembly Language. He has worked with some other programming such as ladder logic with
Programmable Logic Controllers and in working with microcontrollers and programmable logic
gates which hopefully will prove useful in contributing to the goals of this project.
Anthony Figueroa moved design to UML using Sql Workbench and with other team members sketched
skeleton code. UML code used MVC architecture which was later translated into program. 
Anthony also proof-read and formatted reports and milestones.
